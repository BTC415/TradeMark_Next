                <p className=" w-full text-[14px] leading-8 px-10">Advenir has entered into a JV agreement with Imperium Development, headquartered in Atlanta, GA to develop Advenir at Mallory Lake - a new construction, 300-unit garden-style apartment community located within the Atlanta MSA scheduled to be developed and stabilized by Q1 2025 for a total cost basis of $226,472 per unit. This favorable basis attributes to a 30% discount compared to established sales comps in addition to an untrended 6.25% return on cost. The Property is located along the employment powerhouse I-85 corridor, home to Georgia International Business Park, and is within 20 minutes of more than 36,000 jobs. Troup County is home to more Fortune 500 regional sites per capita than anywhere in the United States. As a gateway to both the Atlanta metro area and the pristine beauty of the Georgia Plains, Advenir at Mallory Lake will serve cultural enthusiasts and outdoor lovers alike. Residents of Advenir at Mallory Lake will enjoy its spacious, scenic community nestled amongst the foothills of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Strong demand for quality housing in Troup County has contributed to annual rent growth of 7.9% (CoStar) and median home price growth of 28.1% (Realtor.com). Advenir has underwritten 3.0% rent growth. Housing demand is strong with currently 56% of the workforce being commuters and an additional 15,000 new jobs projected in the next 3 years. The LaGrange Economic Development Authority estimates a need for +2,800 new housing units over the next few years to accommodate the population and job growth. Advenir at Mallory Lake Year 1 pro forma rents start around $1,400 at the low end, which equates to a +40% discount to homeownership as new single-family homes less than 1 mile from Advenir at Mallory Lake have starting prices of $350k+.</p>
                <p className=" w-full text-[14px] leading-8 px-10">Summit Contracting Group, Inc. is the general contractor for the Project. Advenir will self-perform property management functions after the Project has been developed. Of note, horizontal construction has already commenced and the construction loan has been secured through Great Southern Bank. </p>
                <p className=" w-full text-[14px] leading-8 px-10">Construction has already started and the construction loan has closed. Notice to proceed was issued in November 2022 and all building permits have been received. Sitework is completed (see pictures) and wood framing has commenced. Slab on grade prep is underway and Summit Contracting Group has completed over 75% of the trade buyout. The first units and clubhouse are scheduled to be delivered in Q1 2024, with preleasing efforts to start in Q4 2023. The construction loan with Great Southern Bank has closed, with terms as follows: $42.6M, 42-Month Full Term Interest Only, floating over SOFR at 3.00%. Advenir has assumed an average interest rate of 8.3%, although Sponsorship believes it will be in the low 7% range for the length of the loan.</p>
