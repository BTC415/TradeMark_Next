                            Top Performing Multifamily Fundamentals - Local officials have been conservative with housing supply in relation to the rapid job growth that has taken place. Only 3 multifamily communities have been developed in the past 12 years for a total of 558 units. Strong demand for quality housing has contributed to year-over-year effective rent growth of 8% for September 2022 (CoStar). Advenir has underwritten 3.0% rent growth. Physical occupancy within the submarket is strong, averaging 96% across 5 competitive properties. Occupancy and rent growth in the submarket are projected to remain strong as Georgiaâ€™s economy continues to attract corporations in search of a more favorable business and tax environment while providing a lower cost of living to employees.
